# Changelog

All notable changes to `agentic-pipeline` will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
This project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) once it
leaves beta. While in `0.1.x-beta`, breaking changes to slash-command
arguments, manifest fields, or role-file contracts may land in any
release; the `CHANGELOG` will call them out.

## [0.1.0-beta] — 2026-05-09

Initial public beta. The plugin has shipped real features in at least
one project (CivicCast Sprint 0.3); the slash-command edge cases will
surface in your codebase before they surface in the maintainer's.

### Added

- `/pipeline-init` slash command with three onboarding paths:
  PRD/spec document, existing repo (URL or local path), or description
  paragraph. Scaffolds `.pipelines/`, `scripts/policy/`, `CLAUDE.md`,
  and a `.gitignore` entry.
- `/new-run` slash command. Initializes
  `.agent-runs/<run-id>/manifest.yaml` from the template.
- `/run-pipeline` orchestrator slash command. Reads the pipeline YAML,
  walks stages in order, dispatches to one of three handlers
  (human-gate / pipeline-command / agent), writes append-only
  `run.log`, resumes from the right place on re-invocation.
- `feature` pipeline (8 stages: manifest → research → plan →
  test-write → execute → policy → verify → manager).
- `bugfix` pipeline (7 stages: manifest → research → plan →
  reproduce → patch → policy → verify → manager).
- Six role files: researcher, planner, test-writer, executor, verifier,
  manager. Each is the verbatim contract a fresh subagent receives.
- Three policy checks shipped:
  `check_allowed_paths.py`, `check_no_todos.py`,
  `check_adr_gate.py`, plus the `run_all.py` aggregator.
- `manifest-template.yaml` with inline field documentation: `id`,
  `type`, `branch`, `goal`, `allowed_paths`, `forbidden_paths`,
  `non_goals`, `expected_outputs`, `required_gates`, `risk`,
  `rollback_plan`, `definition_of_done`, `director_notes`.
- Documentation: `README.md`, `USER-MANUAL.md` (operator-facing),
  `ARCHITECTURE.md` (with Mermaid diagrams), `docs/index.html`
  (GitHub Pages landing page).

### Lessons baked into defaults

- **Halts apply to ALL repo state changes.** No "obviously safe"
  cleanup PRs while a gate is open.
- **The manager must cite verifier evidence verbatim.** The role file
  forbids encouragement and summarization — these were how bad runs
  promoted in prior projects.
- **Policy checks halt the pipeline on non-zero exit.** No "warning
  only" — that's how scope creep gets in.
- **The `run.log` is append-only.** Editing it to "fix" a stage hides
  the underlying bug. The orchestrator parses the log to determine
  resume point; resume is the only valid recovery.
- **Subagents have fresh context.** Each stage starts with the role
  file + on-disk artifacts. The orchestrator's conversation history is
  not shared.
- **Cleanroom CI is recommended in the orientation summary.** A
  Docker-based reproduction with a fresh dependency set catches
  "works on my machine" bugs that local pytest misses.

### Known limitations

- The orchestrator does not currently support nested pipelines (one
  pipeline invoking another). Out of scope for v0.1.
- The plugin does not enforce that you have committed your manifest
  before starting a run; you can if you want, but `.agent-runs/` is
  gitignored by default.
- The `bugfix` pipeline assumes the bug is reproducible; if it isn't,
  the `reproduce` stage will fail and you'll need to fall back to a
  `feature`-style flow.
- Policy checks are written in Python; if your project doesn't have
  Python available, the policy stage will fail. (Roadmap item: a
  shell-only fallback.)

### Roadmap (not committed — feedback wanted)

- v0.2: optional `cleanroom` stage that runs the test suite in a Docker
  container with a fresh dependency install.
- v0.2: project-specific check templates (e.g.,
  `check_no_console_log.py` for JS projects, `check_ffmpeg_wrapper.py`
  for media projects).
- v0.3: a `refactor` pipeline type for behavior-preserving changes
  (different verifier criteria — diff-mode tests).
- v0.3: a `--dry-run` flag on `/run-pipeline` that walks the stage
  list and prints what would happen without spawning agents.
